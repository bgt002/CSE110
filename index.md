## About Brian
I am Brian, a second year Electrical Computer Engineering Student in Marshall. I enjoy playing games and eating food, especially at 2 am with my friends at **VALLARTA'S MEIXCAN FOOD** which is open *24/7*.

## What inspires Brian
There was once a great athlete, and his work and dedication to the sport is what inspires me to do well in my own work. He had a famous quote, which makes me feel better about myself, which is:
>"Just Live•Laugh•Love #Blessed🙏🏾 #striveforgreatness🚀 😬😆😍" - LeBron James

I remember the first programming lecture I had with Christine Alvarado, and she taught me one of the best lines of code that will stick with me forever:
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
